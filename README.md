Salesforce Project: HandsMen Threads - Solution Design Document

Project Title: Salesforce Implementation for HandsMen ThreadsClient: HandsMen Threads (Fashion Industry)Objective: Enhance data management, ensure data integrity, and improve customer relations using Salesforce.

Project Phases

Phase 1: Architecture & Planning

1. Object Definitions:

Customer__c: Captures customer info (Name, Email, LoyaltyStatus__c, PurchaseHistory__c)

Order__c: Records customer orders (OrderDate__c, Amount__c, Customer__c)

Product__c: Maintains product details (Name, StockQuantity__c, Price__c)

BulkOrder__c: Tracks bulk order data (ScheduledDate__c, Processed__c)

Notification__c: Log of emails and alerts sent (Type__c, DateSent__c, Recipient__c)

2. Relationships:

Customer__c (1) --- (M) Order__c

Order__c (M) --- (M) Product__c (via junction object OrderItem__c)

3. Fields and Formulas:

Customer__c.LoyaltyStatus__c (Formula/Text) based on PurchaseHistory__c

Product__c.LowStock__c (Formula/Checkbox): TRUE if StockQuantity__c < 5

4. Validation Rules:

Prevent order creation if StockQuantity__c = 0

Ensure valid email format on Customer__c

5. Automation Strategy:

Flows:

Record-triggered flow to update LoyaltyStatus__c

Flow to send stock alert emails

Flow to send order confirmation email

Apex Triggers:

Trigger on Order__c to update Product__c inventory

Batch Apex:

Daily batch for bulk order processing at midnight

6. Email Templates:

Order Confirmation (to customers)

Stock Alert (to warehouse team)

Loyalty Update Notification (optional to customers)

Phase 2: Development

Create Custom Objects and Fields

Configure UI using Lightning App Builder

Implement Flows and Apex Triggers

Set up Sharing Rules and Profiles for data access

Schedule and test Batch Jobs

Create Email Templates in Classic or Lightning

Phase 3: Testing & QA

Unit Tests for Apex Classes and Triggers (75%+ coverage)

End-to-End Test Scenarios:

Order placement and confirmation

Loyalty update post-order

Stock alert generation

Security Testing: Validate role-based access

Performance Testing: Evaluate batch job processing

Phase 4: Deployment & Training

Migrate configuration and code to Production Org

Validate scheduled jobs and automations

Conduct User Training Sessions (Sales, Warehouse)

Prepare User Guides and FAQs

Go-Live Support and Monitoring (1st week)

Deliverables

1. Object Model (ERD)

Will include Customer__c, Order__c, Product__c, OrderItem__c, BulkOrder__c, Notification__c

2. Automation Strategy

Mix of declarative (Flows) and programmatic (Apex) solutions

Clear error handling and notifications for failed processes

Scheduled batch jobs for asynchronous processing

Key Learning Outcomes for Team

Design and implementation of custom Salesforce data models

Maintain data integrity using validation and automation

Build and deploy record-triggered flows

Write and schedule Apex and Batch Apex classes

Use Lightning App Builder for user interface customizations

Apply asynchronous programming concepts in real use cases
